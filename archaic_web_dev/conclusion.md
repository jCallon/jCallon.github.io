You've reviewed the 3 major ingredients of a web-page: HTML, CSS, and JS.

Things have come a long way in the past few decades. Writing in raw HTML, CSS, and JS is obsolete, but by no means unusuable or useless. They are the 3 core pieces *every* modern website compiles down to to be able to work on your web browser. Making a website laggy to make it look pretty is the **completely useless, even counter-productive** if your website is targetted towards less powerful devices, making raw HTML, CSS, and JS the go-to.

Our 3 pillars were made before smartphones and before most people had home computers. Most modern websites, such as this one, use abstractions on HTML, CSS, and JS to make web-pages fast to write and adaptable to the variety of devices, resolutions, and aspect ratios accessing them. The original 3 pillars didn't know this world would exist: the internet would become a staple of culture instead of an exclusive government communication channel, the volume/variety of traffic would **require** security to be implemented down the line, running out of unique addresses (IPv4) addresses because there would be **so many websites**, people would use the internet without understanding anything about how it worked from vertical screens... There's a lot of things it wasn't designed for that modern developers have been helping to amend.

Here's two of the most popular frameworks I know:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - make your website stateful and object-oriented
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - make your website mobile-first and adaptable

Here's the frameworks this website uses:
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - how I host the site, I do not have or want to have a server sitting on my floor
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) - parses md files into websites and lets me make reusable templates, which saves me *a lot* of HTML writing
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - writing custom CSS that works flawlessly on mobile and desktop takes *way* too much testing and time
