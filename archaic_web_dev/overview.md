To clear it up as soon as possible, this web-tutorial is *not* about how to make a website like Youtube or the next Facebook. Those sites require servers, careful moderation, handling user information, and the money to fund the whole operation.

If you plan on making an e-commerce site, or anything that handles sensitive user info, I **highly recommend** to *not* make a basic, custom website like you will be here from scratch. Please use an e-commerce site maker, such as [Wix](https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/website), or another provider. Their service fees are worth not having your customer's credit card information stolen and them never buying from or trusting you again.

If you want a more in-depth tutorial after this one, I highly recommend [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). It will be much slower, more thorough, and more methodical. I can't vouch for how useful it is (I do web dev as a hobby instead of a job), but they also offer paid certificates.

What this web-tutorial is *meant* to teach is building the most *basic* websites, which you can do for free, right now, on a computer you don't even own. If you want a picture, and a blast from the past, visit the [1996 Space Jam website](https://www.spacejam.com/1996/jam.html). You will be able to control how your site looks, it won't look as dated as Space Jam unless to want it to. It's a great example and learning experience for how far websites have come, and seeing the bones all modern websites compile to at the end of the day.

### Webhosting (getting a URL to your site)

Once you are satisfied with your website, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) offers free webhosting. It's how I'm hosting this page right here. All you need to do is sign up for free. It offers one website per account, with a customizable URL. Please know, if you choose to host from GitHub, **all of your code will be publicly visible, do NOT upload copyrighted content, or content you don't own**. **Do NOT push *ANY* information you might keep on visitors, such as logins, and DO NOT push passwords**. GitHub repos are scanned by malicious bots *constantly* to find accidental leaks, in other words, potential illegal profit, within *seconds*. Once you push sensitive information, the history of you pushing it and what the contents of the push were will **never** disappear.

Enough scaring, I just really want you to be careful with what you publish to the web. It's a playground, but if to look beyond sand-box, you realize it can be pretty dangerous.

Other web hosting can exit the domain of free very quickly and exits my knowledge domain. For example, [W3schools offers web-hosting](https://www.w3schools.com/spaces/index.html), but it limits your storage and restricts you to a w3schools subdomain.

### Anyways...

To make a website like 1996 Space Jam, we have 3 main ingredients:
