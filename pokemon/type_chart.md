[Pokemon Type Calculator] (https://www.pkmn.help/defense/?types=normal) is an excellent site to get summaries of types, even if you already know the type chart.

If you're already familiar with the type chart, here's some useful reminders:
- Water both resists and deals neutral damage to Steel.
- Dragon resists every starter type, plus Pikachu. So, Fire, Water, Grass, and Electric.
- Bug and Poison resist Fighting. Bug also resists Ground.
- For some reason, Fire resists Fairy, and Fairy is immune to Dragon.

If you're not familiar, no worries! Each type has its own defensive and offensive strengths and weaknesses. Remember, status moves do not follow all these rules, attacks are being explained here.
- Ghost type attacks, such as [Shadow Ball](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/shadowball.shtml), deal double damage to Psychic and other Ghost types.
  - Ghost type attacks are `super effective` against Psychic and other Ghost types.
  - Psychic and Ghost type are `weak to` Ghost type attacks.
- Ghost type Pokémon, such as [Cursola](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/cursola/), take half damage from Poison and Bug type attacks.
- Ghost type Pokémon, such as [Cursola](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/cursola/), take half damage from Poison and Bug type attacks.
  - Poison and Bug type attacks are `not very effective` against Ghost types.
  - Ghost type `resists` Poison and Bug type attacks.
- Cursola takes no damage from Normal type attacks.
  - Normal type moves are `not effective` against Ghost types.
  - Ghost types are `immune to` Normal type attacks.

In summary:
- Defense
  - At Grass and Rock have the most types deal double damage to them, at 5 each.
  - Steel has the most types deal half damage to it, at 10.
  - Ghost is immune to the most types, at 2.
- Offense
  - Fighting and Ground deal double damage to the most types, at 5 each.
  - Dragon deals half damage to the least types, at 1.
  - Grass and Bug deal half damage to the most types, at 7.
- I feel bad for Grass types, but Sprigatito is too cute not to choose.
