# STAB

## Same type attack bonus.

### Body

STAB stands for same type attack bonus. Whenever a Pokemon uses a move of its primary or secondary type, the base power of the move is increased by 50%.
For example:
- [Leech Life](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/leechlife.shtml) is a base 80 power Bug type move. [Sludge Bomb](https://serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/sludgebomb.shtml) is a base 90 power Poison move.
- [Crobat](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/crobat/) is both Flying and Poison type. [Venomoth](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/venomoth/) is both Bug and Poison type.
- If Crobat uses Leech Life, it will have a base power of 80. If Venomoth uses Leech Life, it will have a base power of 120.
- Both Crobat and Venomoth will have a base 135 power Sludge Bomb.

If you’re not good at math, just remember a 50% increase is the original plus half.
- 80 plus half of 80 is 120.
  - `80 + ( 80 / 2 ) = 120`
  - `80 + 40 = 120`
- 90 plus half of 90 is 135.
  - `90 + ( 90 / 2 ) = 135`
  - `90 + 45 = 135`
