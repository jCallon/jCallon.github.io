# Natures

## More than just flavortext, they affect stats.

### Body

Have you ever read your Pokemon is 'Naughty' or 'Serious' in its description? As far as I know, that doesn't actually affect how your Pokemon acts whatsoever, _but_, it does affect its stats, and its interactions with certain healing berries, such as [Aguav Berry](https://www.serebii.net/itemdex/aguavberry.shtml). Related, it also affects its flavor preference, but we won't be focusing on that.

Each nature raises one stat and lowers another stat by 10%, permanently affecting any stat but HP. They can raise and subtract from the same stat, creating 'neutral' natures, such as Serious, that don't affect any stats. This effect is applied after IVs and EVs, and inheriting certain natures when breeding can be manipulated, which we'll talk about later. They are fixed from the time a Pokemon is caught or born.

| ------- |  ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
|    +ATK | Hardy    | Lonely  | Adamant | Naughty | Brave   |
|    +DEF | Bold     | Docile  | Impish  | Lax     | Relaxed |
| +SP.ATK | Modest   | Mild    | Bashful | Rash    | Quiet   |

|    +SPD | Timid    | Hasty   | Jolly   | Naive   | Serious |

Usually, you want a Pokemon's nature to raise their highest stat, and lower their lowest stat. This results in the highest net yield for your Pokemon. Another popular route is choosing either Modest or Adamant, and not using attacking moves of the lowered stat. Then, any amount lost means nothing to you. For example, it almost seems like a waste of a move slot to have a special attacking move on a [Kingler](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/kingler/), or a physical sttacking move on an [Alakazam](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/alakazam/). Both of them have one attack stat that's over twice as high as the other.

I also find it funny how Quirky does nothing.
