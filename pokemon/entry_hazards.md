Have you ever wanted to deal damage without reading your opponent, or perhaps without even attacking? I introduce you to your new love, entry hazards. Sorry, I hope my distaste for these doesn't make the text unreadable.

Entry hazards are moves with effects that persist the entire battle, such as inflicting damage, poisoning, or lowering speed, when and only when a Pokemon switches in. More than 1 type of entry hazard can be active at a time, letting you get all of these effects at once, if you like. Your opponent usually cannot dispel or repel them unless they have certain moves or abilities, such as [Magic Bounce](https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/magicbounce.shtml), [Rapid Spin](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/rapidspin.shtml), or [Defog](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/defog.shtml). The hold item [Heavy-Duty Boots](https://www.serebii.net/itemdex/heavy-dutyboots.shtml) lets a Pokemon, such as [Charizard](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/charizard/), who is 4x weak to Stealth Rock, ignore entry hazards.

| Name | Description | Common uses |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [Spikes](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/spikes.shtml) | Damage-dealing entry hazard. Does not affect Flying or [Levitate](https://www.serebii.net/games/ability.shtml#levitate) Pokemon. Deals more damage with each stack (use), until the 3rd, dealing 1/8, 1/6, then 1/4 max health. | This move was common on [Skarmory](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/skarmory). It takes longer to set up than Stealth Rock, but its damage is consistent, not being affected by type effectiveness, and not being resisted by [Sandstorm](https://www.serebii.net/games/weather.shtml#sandstorm) teams. |
| [Toxic Spikes](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/toxicspikes.shtml) | Poison-inflicting entry-hazard. Does not affect Flying, Steel, Poison, or Levitate Pokemon. In fact, Poison Pokemon absorb and dispel it on switch-in. Deals regular poison at one stack and badly poisoned at 2 stacks. | Combined with poison being annoying, it can also open up enemies to devastating STAB [Venoshock](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/venoshock.shtml) and [Hex](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/hex.shtml). |
| [Stealth Rock](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/stealthrock.shtml) | Damage-dealing entry hazard. Does not have immunities or stacks, instead doing 1/8 max health, multiplied by the victim's Rock resistance/weakness. For example, at a 4x Rock weakness, it does `1 / 8 * 4 = 1 / 2` max health. | Flying, Bug, Fire, Ice, and/or [Sturdy](https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/sturdy.shtml)/[Focus Sash](https://www.serebii.net/itemdex/focussash.shtml) begone. Those Pokemon with 2 HP left will probably need to be sacked, because they'll faint if they switch back in. |
| [Sticky Web](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/stickyweb.shtml) | Speed-dropping entry hazard. Does not affect Flying or Levitate Pokemon. No stacks, just use it once and each Pokemon that switches will start with their speed lowered by 1 stage. | If your opponent is all offense, they won't appreciate moving last any turn. And if your team is slow, they will appreciate having a chance to move first. |
