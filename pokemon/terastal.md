# Terastal

## The newest regional gimick.

### Body

This is all speculation right now off of reading the Official Pokemon website. we haven't seen how the edge-cases of the phenomena actually plays out yet.

Terastal can be used once per battle and lasts until the end of battle, instead of until switch-out. Trainers carry the Terastal Orb, instead of needing a Pokemon to hold it as a held item, unlike [Mega Evolutions](https://www.serebii.net/pokemon/megaevolution.shtml).

Terastal does 3 things, while in effect:
- Turn a Pokemon's type into a mono-type of its Tera type, determined by its IVs.
- If the neither of the Pokemon's types were already that type, it gives moves of the Tera type normal STAB, in addition to its previous STAB types.
- If the either of the Pokemon's types were already that type, instead of giving more types of STAB, it gives moves of the Tera boosted STAB.
