# IVs and EVs

## Ways to permanently modify your Pokemon's stats.

### Body

Get on your inch-thick glasses and hunch that back! If you want to take advantage of this in a mainline game, it's grinding time!

IVs (inherited values) and EVs (effort values) are numeric values that let you permanently modify a Pokemon's stats. How much it modifies your Pokemon's stats scales with level, level 100 seeing the greatest impact. The math is complicated, so go to Teambuilder on [Pokemon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/) to see how much certain IVs and EVs mean at certain levels. In summary, they can be the difference between a level 50 modest [Gengar](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/gengar/) having 148 and 199 special attack!

#### IVs

IVs are (historically) constant numbers assigned to your Pokemon at catch or birth, ranging from 0 to 31 in each stat. Higher number means higher stat. If you've ever wondered why people breed a lot of the same Pokemon, they could be shiny-hunting, or it could be because they are trying to manipulate IVs and natures.

Hatched Pokemon will have IVs between their parents', and almost always be the same species as their mother. If one parent has 31 IV health but 0 IV defense, and the other parent has 0 IV health bit 31 IV defense, usually you want the child to get both 31 IVs, but what might happen is the child gets both 0 IVs, or somewhere in-between on both. It's the luck of the draw... unless? [Power items](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Power_item) can guarantee inheriting certain IVs from certain parents, and [Everstone](https://www.serebii.net/itemdex/everstone.shtml)s can guarantee natures from certain parents. Hidden abilities have a chance of being passed down from the mother (or any/none gender parent if bred with a [Ditto](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/ditto/)).

With 0 EVs, 31 IVs is the difference between a level 50 modest Gengar having 148 or 165 special attack.

#### EVs

In new games, EVs can be changed any time over the life of a Pokemon, ranging from 0-252 on each stat, capping at a 508 total. I lied, it's 255 each and a 512 cap, but only full mutliples of 4 are counted and actually matter, give you the tiniest bit of wiggle room. If you've ever wondered why someone was seeking and fainting hordes of Bidoofs like they deserve to be exterminated from the world, the were probably trying to raise a Pokemon's HP EV.

EVs are raised by fainting enemy Pokemon. Usually a Pokemon's EV yield will be its highest stat, and an additional 1 point, starting at 1, each evolution. Power items can be used to raise this yield, and experience share to share it and avoid extra work. Triggering hordes with power items is by far the best way to get the highest yield for free. Serebii is a good place to consult for figuring out [what EVs a species yields](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/) (see the 'By Effort Values' filter). If you have spare money lying around, there's also EV raising items, [Vitamins](https://www.serebii.net/itemdex/list/vitamins.shtml). If you would like to like to lower a Pokemon's EVs, you can do so any time with [EV-lowering berries](https://pokemondb.net/pokebase/48404/what-are-ev-reducing-berries).

With 0 IVs, 252+ EVs is the difference between a level 50 modest Gengar having 148 and 182 special attack.

#### Bigger isn't always better

It's ok to have Pokemon have low stats. It's up to you to determine the worth of all hard-core breeding and training, using the aforementioned Teambuilder. Maybe you actually _want_ lowered stats, such as poor HP on a Pokemon using [Pain Split](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/painsplit.shtml), poor defenses on a Pokemon using [Counter](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/counter.shtml) or [Mirror Coat](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/mirrorcoat.shtml), poor attack on something weak to [Foul Play](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/foulplay.shtml) or that gets confused a lot, or poor speed on a Pokemon using [Revenge](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/revenge.shtml) or [Trick Room](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/trickroom.shtml). It's all up to you!
