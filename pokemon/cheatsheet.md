subtitle: A tool to help inform your decisions.

[VGC](https://www.pokemon.com/us/strategy/an-introduction-to-the-video-game-championships) is one of the hearts of competetive Pokemon. Another is [Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/), an online Pokemon battle simulator that doesn't require you own a game, needs no griding, and lets you simulate pretty much and situation, so I'll be talking about it instead. It has thousand of active players at a time to tussle in competetive matches and matchmaking with. Consider looking at their community forms too!

It might interest you to follow content creators for it and learn from them, such as [Freezai](https://www.youtube.com/c/FreezaiPokemon), and see teams others are using in VGC or Showdown. Being the nerds competetive Pokemon players are, they've made an online tool called the [Damage Calculator](https://calc.pokemonshowdown.com/) to calculate exactly\* how much damage any move will do in a given scenario.

The asterisk is because attacks can get 'high rolls' and 'low rolls' in Pokemon, meaning it's possible for the same move in the exact same scenario to do different amounts of damage. In other words, itâ€™s a tool to help inform your decisions, but not make them. For the sake of how much this tool knows and how powerful it is, I call it 'The Cheatsheet'. Many Showdown players have it open in another tab while they play.
