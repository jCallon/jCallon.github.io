You might already be familiar with status effects, but if you didn’t know status effects do more than just hurt or stop a pokemon from moving, or just want to review, it’s worth going over. Of note: these are generalizations of each status effect, there's all sorts of edge cases, such [Guts](https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/guts.shtml) ignoring Burn damage reduction, and Steel types being unable to be poisoned. 

Of note, the effect of status effects vary a bit game by game, but I'll show their most recent effects here. 

Common status effects:

| Name     | Description | Common uses |
| -------- | ------------| ----------- |
| [Burn](https://www.serebii.net/games/status.shtml#burn) | Hurts for 1/16th of health each turn, halves Attack stat. | Crippling a strong physical attacker for a whole match. |
| [Paralysis](https://www.serebii.net/games/status.shtml#paralysis) | Gives 25% chance of immobility each turn, halves Speed stat. | Slowing a Pokemon for a whole match. |
| [Sleep](https://www.serebii.net/games/status.shtml#sleep) | Gives 100% chance of immobility for 1-7 turns. Rest inflicts 2 turns, and certain moves can be used during sleep. Very abusable, check if your ruleset has a [Sleep Clause](https://pokemondb.net/pokebase/50429/what-is-the-sleep-clause). | Immobilizing an enemy then stat boosting or switching to a stronger Pokemon to finish it off. |
| [Frozen](https://www.serebii.net/games/status.shtml#freeze) | Gives 100% chance of immobility unless the victim has specific moves to thaw itself, with a 20% change of escape each turn. Uncapped number of turns. | Catching opponents by surprise, it's much harder to inflict and much less common than sleep. |
| [Poison](https://www.serebii.net/games/status.shtml#poison) | Hurts for 1/8th of health each turn. | Widdling opponents down in a way they can't [Protect](https://serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/protect.shtml). |
| Badly Poisoned | Hurts for 1/16th health each turn, 2nd turn 2/16th, 3rd turn 3/16ths, etc. Poison types can't miss [Toxic](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/toxic.shtml). | Widdling down an especially tanky Pokemon that gladly eats and recovers from attacks. |

A few less common status effects:

| Name | Description | Common uses |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Infatuation | Some moves and abilities, such as [Attract](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/taunt.shtml) can inflict it. Gives 50% chance of immobility until the victim or the inflicter are switched out or faint. Relies on Pokemon being opposite genders to be able to inflict. | Can be paired with flinching, as Gen 2 players are well aware of. Many Pokemon, can only be or are a high proportion male, making them easy targets. |
| Flinch | Many moves, such as [Air Slash](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/airslash.shtml), have a chance of dealing it. Gives 100% chance of immobility for the rest of the turn the victim was hit. | Often paired with paralysis to 'paraflinch', making your opponent want to throw their controller at the wall. |
| [Taunt](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/taunt.shtml) | Makes a Pokemon unable to use status moves for 3 turns. | Stopping tanks or Toxic campers from camping successfully. |
| [Encore](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/encore.shtml) | Forces a Pokemon to reuse their last move for 3 turns. | Locking opponents into [Rest](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/rest.shtml), [Protect](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/protect.shtml), recoil moves, or spamming any other status moves that are only meant to be used once. |
| [Disable](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/encore.shtml) | Prevents a Pokemon from using its last used move for 4 turns. | Disabling an attacking move or Choice item user. |
| Trapped | Many moves, such as [Whirlpool](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/encore.shtml), can prevent an enemy from being able to switch out for a number of turns, given the trapper hasn't switched out. | Can be paired with other status conditions to make each turn agonizing an inescapable. |
| Perish Song | All Pokemon on the field, when [Perish Song](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/perishsong.shtml) is used, will faint in 3 turns if not switched out. | Providing a 100% certain faint on a Pokemon that can't switch out. |
| Leech Seed | Takes 1/8th of the victim's HP each turn and gives it to the inflicter. Can be [Baton Pass](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/batonpass.shtml)ed. | Healing and dealing more status damage to opponents. |
