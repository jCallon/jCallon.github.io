[Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/), an online Pokemon battle simulator, and one of the hearts of competitive Pokemon. It's free, needs no griding, and is teeming with players looking to fight in competetive matches. It comes with competetive matchmaking, a chat system, and community forums, if you don't quite want to fight. It might interest you to follow content creators for it and learn from them, such as [Freezai](https://www.youtube.com/c/FreezaiPokemon). Being the nerds they are, they've made an online tool called the [Damage Calculator](https://calc.pokemonshowdown.com/) to calculate exactly\* how much damage any move will do in a given scenario.

The asterisk is because attacks can get 'high rolls' and 'low rolls' in Pokemon, meaning it's possible for the same move in the exact same scenario to do different amounts of damage. In other words, itâ€™s a tool to help inform your decisions, but not make them.
