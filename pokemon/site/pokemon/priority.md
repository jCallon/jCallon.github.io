You might already know some moves make a Pokemon 'go first'. That's not the truth, just a generalization, but the whole truth isn't so bad to learn.

There's the normal speed stat, faster Pokemon goes first that turn, etc.. Yes, that makes sense. What takes a bit more understanding is 'speed bracket's. Most moves are bracket 0. A move that says it 'goes first', like [Quick Attack](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/quickattack.shtml), is usually bracket +1, the bracket right above.

So while each Pokemon has a speed stat, each move also has a speed bracket. Moves execute first according to speed bracket, then Pokemon speed.

Let's put this into an example:
- [Calm Mind](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/calmmind.shtml) is speed bracket 0. [Quick Attack](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/quickattack.shtml) is speed bracket +1.
- [Raikou](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/raikou) has 115 speed. [Lucario](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/lucario) has 91 speed.
- If Raikou uses Quick Attack and Lucario uses Calm Mind, Raikou will go first, because its move had a higher speed bracket.
- If Raikou uses Calm Mind and Lucario uses Quick Attack, Lucario will go first, because its move had a higher speed bracket.
- If Raikou and Lucario use the same move, Raikou will go first, because both moves will be in the same speed bracket, and its speed is higher.

For a list of all non-0 speed bracket move, see [here](https://www.serebii.net/games/speedpriority.shtml). As there are +1 and +2 speed brackets, there are also -1 and -2, speed brackets, etc.. [Vital Throw](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/vitalthrow.shtml) is bracket -1, and [Focus Punch](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/focuspunch.shtml) is bracket -3, for example. As of the time of writing this, the lowest is -7, and the highest is +5.

What use is all this?
- See the classic example up top for how understanding priority and items lets a level 1 [Rattata](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/rattata/) beat a level 100 [Arceus](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/arceus/), earning it its own infamous acronym, FEAR (focus-sash endeavor quick-attack Rattata).
- The normally unremearkable [Linoone](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/arceus/) becomes a *terrifying beast* when it uses [Belly Drum](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/bellydrum.shtml) then STAB Extremespeed.
- If an enemy Pokemon has boosted speed and offense, and you aren't packing any items or abilties that let you take a hit with guarantee of not fainting, priority moves might be your only chance of knocking it out before it faints your whole team.
