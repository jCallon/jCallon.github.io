subtitle: The things you didn't know you wanted until you couldn't live without them.

Certain held items are game-changing, but many of those held items are locked in post-game, so players don't know about them when just playing through the game casually. There's easily over 50 held items, but let's just go over some important ones.

{: .table .table-striped}
| Name | Effect | Common usage |
| ---- | ------ | ------------ |
| Eviolite | Raises unevolved Pokemon's defense stats by 50%. | Combined with IVs and EVs, which we'll get into later, lets [Chansey](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/chansey/) have a higher defense and base stat total than [Blissey](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/blissey/), making many actually prefer it over its evolution. |
| Focus sash | If a Pokemon is at full health, lets it survive a move that would KO it with one health. | Guaranteeing\* glass cannons, such as [Gengar](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/gengar/), get to live 2 turns, and letting Pokemon release devasting reversals... such as [Reversal](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/reversal.shtml). |
| Life orb | Raises a Pokemon's damage output by 30%, at the cost of 10% HP each turn | Making speedy glass cannons with great offensive coverage, such as [Alakazam](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/alakazam/) hit *even harder*. Also has some interesting interactions with abilities I'll get into later. |
| Choice specs | Raises a Pokemon's damage output by 50%, but locks the Pokemon into only using its picked first move until switched. | Making high-power moves even stronger, such as giving [Primarina](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/primarina/) even more power on [Torrent](https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/torrent.shtml) boosted [Hydro Pump](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/hydropump.shtml). |
| Choice band | Same but attack. | Same but for attack moves, such as [Surging Strikes](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/surgingstrikes.shtml).
| Choice scarf | Same but speed. | Surprising opponents by going first when you normally don't, and winning speed ties or losses, such as with [Imposter](https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/imposter.shtml) [Ditto](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/ditto/). |
| Weakness policy | If hit by a super-effective attack, boosts attack and special attack by 2 stages. | Popular on legendaries, or other pokemon that don't faint in one super-effective blow. Even not having it, if you make your opponent worry you do, they might opt out of using super-effective moves. |
| Custap berry | When at low health, raises next attack's speed priority by 1. | Great on [Endure](https://serebii.net/attackdex-xy/endure.shtml) or [Sturdy](https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/sturdy.shtml) pokemon without access to priority moves for flipping the tide of battle. |
| Power herb | Skips charging time for 1 move. | Was a *very* popular item on [Xerneas](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/xerneas/), let it use [Geomancy](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/geomancy.shtml) in one turn, which let its next [Moonblast](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/moonblast.shtml) deal `95 * Fairy Aura * STAB * 2 stage SP.ATK boost = 380` base power, not even mentioning Xerneas' double special defense and speed.
