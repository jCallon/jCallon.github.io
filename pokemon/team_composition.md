# Team Composition

## The most obvious but hardest part of it all.

### Body

Perhaps you've fought Gym Leaders and thought, 'I'm just clicking one move and winning. How do they have their jobs?'. Gym leaders have some of the worst team composition, to teach you the strengths and weaknesses of each type before you have to fight a Champion, which will hopefully take more than clicking one move. ... Maybe 2, if you have [Dragon Dance](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-sm/dragondance.shtml). There is no 'best team', but there are many aspects that go into making a good one.

#### Diversity approach

Prepare for everything. A Pokemon for each scenario.
- Offensive diversity
  - You'll often hear this called 'offensive coverage'.
  - The types of the moves you choose matter.
    - If your team only has Normal type attacks, they'll going to have *a lot* of trouble versus any Ghost.
  - Whether your attacks are physical or special matters.
    - If you only have physical attackers, no Pokemon might be able to break through a Defensive wall.
    - Even if a move is strong, if the type it's super-effective against usually has twice as much Defense as Special Defense, physical attacks might not be very effective.
  - More than just attacks matter, status moves do too.
    - Some Pokemon recover HP faster than you can deal damage, if you don't have a move like Toxic or stat-raising moves, you might not be able to faint that Pokemon.
  - Offense can be defense.
    - Having strong super-effective moves for dealing with common counters to your Pokemon might prevent your foe from being able to use that counter effectively on you.
  - Priority moves provide offensive pressure, forcing low-health enemies to switch out or sack that Pokemon.
- Defensive diversity
  - You'll often hear this called 'defensive coverage'.
  - The types of your Pokemon matter.
    - Having a resistant switch-in can save your Pokemon from needing to be fainted and prevent overall damage to your team.
  - Whether your defense is physical or special matters.
    - High defense is great, but if it's the only thing you have, you're very prone to getting swept by special attacker once they've stat-boosted.
  - Can your team recover health it's lost?
    - It's fine if the answer is no, but if that's the case, you need to get into the mentality that every HP loss is permanant.
  - Defense can be offense.
    - Having the defenses to be able to tank hits while you stat-boost or inflict status conditions can make your Pokemon deal damage just as well as it takes it.
  - Despite being attacks, priority moves are also a precious defensive resource to prevent you from being helpless to and getting swept by a speed-boosted Pokemon.

#### Specialization approach

Create a team so good at one thing it cannot be stopped. All Pokemon to capitalize on one scenario. Often, this is the approach of weather teams.
- Offensive oppression
  - Deal the most damage possible at any time. The goal is to end the game quickly before your scenario, such as weather, ends, unles you have an easy way to extend it. Being super-effective is less of a concern when all your moves are around or above base 100 power, before STAB.
  - An example of moves used are STAB [Hurricane](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/hurricane.shtml) and [Weather Ball](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/weatherball.shtml) in rain.
  - An example of abilties used is [Sand Force](https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/sandforce.shtml) in sandstorm, to make STAB [Earthquake](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/earthquake.shtml), [Iron Head](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/ironhead.shtml), and [Stone Edge](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/stoneedge.shtml) even more powerful.
- Defensive oppression
  - Defense isn't so much of a concern, but moves like [Aurora Veil](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/auroraveil.shtml), and sandstorm just providing a 1 stage Special Defense raise for certain types, helps.

#### Mixed Approach

You don't have to go strictly one approach or another, they're both just ends of a spectrum. Perhaps, you can make a team that's diverse, but has a hidden, potent sweeper in the back waiting to capitalize when the time is right, like [Linoone](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/linoone/#) with [Gluttony](https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/gluttony.shtml), an HP berry, [Belly Drum](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/bellydrum.shtml), and STAB [Extremespeed](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/extremespeed.shtml).
