## 'The only way to beat weather is with more weather.'

### Body

Way back in 2002, there were 2 Pokemon who seeked to pulverize the world into submission with insane weather. I'm talking about [Kyogre](https://serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/kyogre/) and [Groudon](https://serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/groudon/). The battle still goes on, many competetive players still carrying the torch. Although weather isn't its former glory, having extreme varients and lasting the entire battle, it's still stupid good. As of writing this, there are 4 noteworthy types of weather. When cast, they last 5 turns by default. [Weather Ball](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/weatherball.shtml), in weather, becomes a base 100 power special attack of the type of the weather.

Part of why weather can be so good is its ability to boost already powerful STAB attacks into beasts stronger than super-effective attacks (`1 * 1.5 * 1.5 = 2.25`, which is greater than 2). That, paired with each variant having a speed boosting and auto-set ability, make offensive power out of hand. If you're eager to join the weather wars, just remember, the slowest weather auto-set ability wins, making slow [Torkoal](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/torkoal/) and [Hippowdon](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/hippowdon/) ideal weather setters. Weather is used more often in doubles than singles. Weather isn't a sure win, but it's a tough foe to fight.
