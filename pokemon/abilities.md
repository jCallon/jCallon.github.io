# Abilities

## What make Pokemon unique.

### Body

A mechanic sorely (to me) missing from Pokemon Legends: Arceus and Pokemon GO is abilities. There's classic, straighforward abilities most casual players have felt, like [Levitate](https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/levitate.shtml) and [Run Away](https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/runaway.shtml).

There's also abilties, that when used in conjunction with items and other mechanics, are quite powerful. Here's some of them.

| Name | Description | Common use  |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [Sheer Force](https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/sheerforce.shtml) | Your moves have their secondary effects replaced with a 1.3x power boost. | Stacking this ability with [Life Orb](https://www.serebii.net/itemdex/lifeorb.shtml), Nidoking can deal a base `90 * STAB * life orb (1.3) * sheer force (1.3) = 228.15` Earth Power with no Life Orb recoil, and without being locked into a move from Choice Band. |
| [Guts](https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/guts.shtml) | Status conditions give you a 1.5x attack boost, and burn damage reduction is ignored. | Stacking this ability with [Fire Orb](https://www.serebii.net/itemdex/fireorb.shtml), this lets the Normal types have a base `70 * STAB * guts (1.5) * 2 = 315` Facade. Having a physical attacker immune to Burn damage reduction is valuable. |
| [Prankster](https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/prankster) | Your status moves get +1 priority on non-Dark types. | This ability, combined with Assist and [Lagging Tail](https://www.serebii.net/itemdex/laggingtail.shtml), infamously made Purloin a near-unstoppable menace. It's no surprise Sword and Shield removed the move Assist after. It's an annoying, high-potential ability. |
| [Serene Grace](https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/serenegrace.shtml) | Your moves have their chances for secondary effects doubled. | Perhaps you've heard of 'paraflinching', a... lower regarded tactic. Popular for flinch-locking targets and leaving burns. |
| [Regenerator](https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/regenerator.shtml) | When switching out, you restore 1/3 of your total health. | Was popular on [Amoonguss](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/amoonguss), the funny-named, ugly mushroom that probably invented the Sleep Clause. Take damage, [Spore](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/spore.shtml), switch out to something strong and recover health. |
| [Intimidate](https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/intimidate.shtml) | On entry, you reduce all enemy's attack by 1 stage. | A classic ability, great in doubles on [Hitmontop](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/hitmontop) and others. Your Pokemon doesn't even need to move to reduce damage to your team. |
| [Technician](https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/technician.shtml) | You moves with 60 power or less (before STAB) get a 1.5x damage boost. | Technician [Scisor](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/scisor) is a classic. Pair a 130 base power Pokemon with a STAB boosted, technician boosted priority move like [Bullet Punch](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-xy/bulletpunch.shtml)? It's far from a surprise anymore but it's still menacing. |
