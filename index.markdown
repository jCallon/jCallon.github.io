# Welcome to my pile-o-stuff!

Hi, I don't have a home page quite yet. :)
I have a lot of things I want to put on this website, and only 2 are close to done right now.

This website is all on my [Github](https://github.com/jCallon/jCallon.github.io).

- Free hobbies
  - [Intro to Pokemon](pokemon/cheatsheet.html)
  - Make custom 3D avatars - Blender & Unity
  - Make SVGs - Inkscape
  - [Make a basic web page (HTML/CSS/JS) - Any web browser, Notepad++ (optional)](archaic_web_dev/overview.html)
  - Make a modern web page (React/Bootstrap) - Any web browser, WSL (optional)
  - Set up a decent puTTY/VIM environment - puTTY
  - Make a stream overlay - OBS, I forget what else
  - Use Git - WSL (optional)
- Tools
  - [Console artist](console_artist/console art.html)
  - (Not sure if I can accomplish this one) Retro Music Composer
  - Character generator
